## Business Understanding
Industry stakeholders: Investors, Movie studios, producers and actors, distributors such as streaming platform, marketing firm, and audiences. <br>
The movie making industry is highly competitive. For Microsoft to break into this market, it is essential to identify key aspects of successful movie and learn from these cases. 
## Data Understanding 
The data we used in this project are from Movie Box Gross, Movie Budget, Tomato Movie, and IMDB database.
- **Movie Box Gross** provides movie titles, studios, domestic and foreign gross numbers.
- **Movie Budget** provides movie names, production budgets, domestic and worldwide sales.
- **Tomato Movie** provides movie names, voting averages, online voting counts.
- **IMDB** provides movie names, genres, actors, directors, runtimes, and ratings.

## Approach
I use exploratory data analysis to find out what would be the best movie to make for Microsoft Movie Studio. The analysis is conducted on 3 metrics:
1. Profits vs. budget 
2. Popularity vs. online exposure
3. Movie success based on genre

## Key business questions
- Does higher budget make movie more profitable?
- What factor contributes to the popularity of a movie?
- How genre affects the profitability of a movie?

## Analysis  
We found that there is a positive correlation between movie budget and profit.

## Conclusions
**The 1st recommendation:** we recommend Microsoft Movie Studio to make their first moview with a higher production budget <br>
Top 5% of movies that generated the most revenues invest $140,000,000 on average. <br>
**The 2nd recommendation:** Get as much exposure for the first movie. Spend at least industry average level to marketing to increase online exposure, which is directly related to the popularity of a movie. <br>
**The 3rd recommendation:** Make a movie across multiple genres. More genres means more exposure to different audiences. 

## Looking Forward
To further elaborate current strategy, I would like to include an analysis of macro factors. <br>

**Social media** <br>
It is an area that changing very fast and how to leverage social media to increase exposure is key for movie studios. <br>

**Online streaming platform** <br>
This Market has transformed from Netflix being No.1 to Netflix, HBO, Disney Plus and many other small ones competing. I expect the competition will only get more fierce and that would help movie studio to diversify the pipelines of revenue streams. <br>

**Social aspects** <br>
We are living in a world that is changing very fast. People could be talking totally different topics in a matter of 5 years or even 3 years. How to capture the hot topics of each time would also be a main task for every studio.
